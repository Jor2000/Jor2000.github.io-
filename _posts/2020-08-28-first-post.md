This is my **first post**.

[Here's a website I like](http://vans.com)

Howdy! My name is Jory and I am a Senior English major from San Antonio, TX. Hobbies that I have are journaling and occasionally writing poetry; I love to write and I've had a journal for as long as I can remember. I also enjoy reading, going to the movies, watching Dr.Who, listening to music, roadtrips, and taking long naps. I was interested in taking Digital Authoring because I wanted to learn more about "digital" writing, and the different careers that I could possibly pursue from this genre or style of writing. I am always looking for new ways to improve my writing, so I am hoping that this course will help me to excel. I am excited to learn more over the semester with the different readings and activities planned!
