title: All About Metadata: A Reflection
---

In this week's class we learned all about metadata; what it is, what it does, and how it ultimately contributes to the digital
English world. Being an English major, I was initally baffled when first reading about data, as I was not aware how crucial data
is or how often digital authors actually utilize it. Never in a million years did I suspect that I, myself, would be working with
data, that's only for computer science majors or engineers right? False. After actively engaging with the reading topics, and seeing 
how they affect our blogs and individual posts, I have become more encouraged and found that learning about metadata was genuniely
interesting. 
First we have our basic hard, cold data, which as Dr.Pilsch says is "the raw bits of facts and figures from which information is
derived."
