For my image, I posted a picture of a sunset to my site as a representation of the things that I have been able to do during quarantine.
In the beginning of quarantine, staying inside and learning how to limit social contact was very difficult; our society is not used
to being limited socially, and after having come back for a week long retreat in Arkansas with all of my friends, I was defnitely not
happy about having to be inside all the time. In March, I had to go back to San Antonio because my parents felt more at ease with my sister 
and I at home amidst the outbreak of Covid. My parents have a very small two bedroom, one restroom house; the kitchen, the living room, and the 
dining area are all in one room. I have never lived in a house so small, especially since my parents had just recently moved into this house. 
From the end of March all the way until the beginning of August, I stayed inside the house all day, nearly everyday. Another difficult task during
quarantine was trying to find something entertaining to do: watch netflix 24/7, read, watch youtube videos, eat, listen to music, watch more netflix,
etc. Needless to say, there were not many options to keep myself from boredom, either that or I lack creativity; however, one of the few things that 
helped me to keep my sanity was watching the sunset everyday. I'll admit that watching the sunset is a cliche, but I have loved to watch the sunset for 
as long as I can remember. Whenever it was difficult or suffocating to be inside, I would go and sit out in the backyard and watch the sunset, or on
certain days my family and I would go for a walk in the evening at our local park; on those days at the park, I would always be able to see the
sunset in full. Watchning the sunset always gave me peace from everything that was going on in the world; the sunset made me feel as though it was
the light at the end of this confusing tunnel. Seeing the sunset every evening also brought me peace because it reminded me of God, and even though I was 
very anxious or upset because of the given circumstances, the sunset never failed to remind me that God was with me during those times of difficulty. Each day
the sunset was never the same; one day it would paint the whole sky with glorious streaks of orange and red, another day it would be peaking from behind the
clouds with beams of light pouring through, and another day the sun would present its normal light, slowly turning orange until it faded away like the embers
of a once blazing fire. I chose to write about this topic because I felt that as Covid has now impacted the lives of millions of people, living the 'quarantine
life' is a difficult adjustment that everyone has grow acustom to. The 'quarantine life,' along with wearing masks everywhere in public, has become the new 
normal. Even though we have to wear masks out in public places, and continue campaigning for social distancing, ultimately we are all still human. Watching
the sunset reminds that I am human.
